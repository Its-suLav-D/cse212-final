# Introduction to Data Strucutres and Algorithms ➗

There are many programming languages 👨🏼‍💻 to use and understand but the principle of algorithms and data structures remain fundamental, irrespective of the language we use. The most basic principle of programming is algorithms and data structures. They are the main building blocks that are used to create complex applications that we use in our daily life. Understanding the fundamental principles of software design and development is highly critical. Before diving our feet into the data structures and algorithm let me tell you that a large majority of the interview questions at FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and others are drawn from the topics which we are going to learn today. With that being said, in this article, we will be exploring about Data Structures and its type however algorithm’s part will be covered in another article.

Data Structures basically, starts with data and end up having Structures and these structures have different names and use cases depending on its Structure. Essentially, talking about Data Structures types there are: Array, Strings, Lists, Stacks and Queues, Binary Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables, Binary Search Tree and many more. However, in this article we will be focusing more on Stacks and Queues, Linked List and Trees. Importantly, till now you might have used array’s thousands of times, and I have to say that it is a crucial topic however sometimes it is better to use linked list or Trees or Stacks instead of Array. Therefore, by the end of this article you will know what linked list, stacks and tree are, how they appear, how to use them, when to use them, and create an efficient algorithm.

1. Stack – An Array like Data Structure whose elements follow the LIFO rule: Last in First out. We might compare it with the stock of books on the table: the last book placed on the stack of books is the first one that’s taken out.

2. Linked Lists – A data Structure that consist of nodes, each with some value and pointer to the next Node in the Linked List. Use Linked Lists to store item anywhere in memory. Be comfortable with iteration, insertion, and deletion within the singly and doubly linked lists. [Click Here to Learn more about Linked list](./draft2-linked-list.md)

3. Tree – Use for representing hierarchical data. Learn about Depth height, leaf, traversal sequences, in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal. [Click Here to Learn more about Trees](./draft-2-tree.md)
